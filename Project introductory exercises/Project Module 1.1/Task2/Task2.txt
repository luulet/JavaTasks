Let's look at a supermarket's operational system as an example. Customers are more likely to go grocery shopping at
certain times of the day, such as after work or during weekends. This creates variability in the amount of
customers and in checkout queue lengths depending on the time of day.

The system is also complex because it has many interacting components, for instance customers, employees, suppliers,
inventory and checkout counters. The amount of checkout counters and employees affect customer waiting times and overall
service quality. Managing inventory with different suppliers adds extra layers of complexity.

There is strong interconnectedness within the supermarket system. For example delays in supplier deliveries can
lead to inventory problems and having no stock of certain products. This will affect customers satisfaction that lead
to sales. High customer traffic can lead to being short-staffed and increase customer's waiting time. The pricing of
a product affect its demand, which needs to be taken into consideration when doing the inventory operations.
As each element has affects on one another, a supermarket is managed as an interconnected system.
