A simulation could be used to analyze different types of road intersections. Let's say that you have unconnected roads,
and you need an intersection. It would make sense to simulate intersections with different lane designs, with and without
traffic controls and with different amount of traffic. Testing different types of intersections can be done easily in
simulations as for example adding an extra lane can be done in seconds. In the real world it would be costly to
construct that same lane, without even knowing if it would improve the flow of traffic, hence simulations are used.
